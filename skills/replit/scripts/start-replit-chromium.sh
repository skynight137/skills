#!/usr/bin/env bash
# start-replit-chromium.sh — idempotent, ON-DEMAND launcher for the Replit
# Playwright-managed Chromium as a headless CDP daemon. Serves
# references/playwright-chromium.md.
#
# Scope: REPLIT's store browser ONLY ($REPLIT_PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE).
# It deliberately does NOT fall back to any other browser — the Hermes bundled
# Chrome is a separate lane with its own installer and launcher, see
# setup.sh --hermes-browser (launch-hermes-chrome) and references/browser-lanes.md.
#
# Why no LD_LIBRARY_PATH here: the Replit store Chrome is a self-contained
# wrapper — it exports its own SSL_CERT_FILE/FONTCONFIG_FILE and execs a bundled
# binary with its own RPATH. It needs NO /nix/store closure. (Builds that DO
# need one — e.g. Hermes' chrome-linux64 — resolve it at install time in
# setup/hermes_chromium.sh via setup/resolve-libs.sh, never a hardcoded hash.)
#
# Usage: run ONCE when you need the browser; a no-op if the CDP port is live.
# Do NOT schedule it on recurring cron — launch on demand, kill it when done.
#
# Multiple agents: Chromium locks --user-data-dir (SingletonLock), so two
# instances can NEVER share one profile dir. Give each its own port + data dir:
#   CHROME_PORT=9223 CHROME_DATA_DIR="$XDG_DATA_HOME/chromium/agent-b" \
#       bash start-replit-chromium.sh
