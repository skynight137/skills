# shellcheck shell=bash
# Camofox browser (anti-detection Firefox server) — npm-global install.
# Sourced by setup.sh.
#
# Design: the npm package IS the interface. `setup.sh --camofox` installs
# `@askjo/camofox-browser` globally, so you call the real binaries directly —
# `camofox-browser` (server) and `camofox-browser-mcp` (MCP adapter). There is
# no wrapper script and no env file; a default loopback server needs no key.
#
# Replit-specific work this module does (all measured on-box):
#   1. lib closure — Camoufox-Firefox needs the transitive GTK/X11/ALSA closure
#      from /nix/store, which the Replit loader never searches. generate-closure.sh
#      writes it and EXCLUDES the network/TLS families (openssl/curl/…) so the
#      closure is safe on a GLOBAL LD_LIBRARY_PATH (an unpruned one shadows the
#      platform openssl and breaks curl). See rc.sh / the managed shell block for
#      the wiring; the pool dir is also prepended there.
#   2. WebGL spoof — camoufox-js seeds WebGL from a LIVE GPU sample. On a
#      GPU-less Replit (no /dev/dri) there is no GL context (WebGL is null) and
#      the spoof HANGS every Firefox content process, so pages never load. We
#      patch the installed camoufox-js to AUTO-SKIP (detect /dev/dri at launch),
#      so no env var and no wrapper is needed; a GL-capable host keeps the full
#      spoof. Override with CAMOFOX_SKIP_WEBGL_FP=0|1.
#   3. newPage timeout — camofox.config.json ships 10000ms, too tight for a cold
#      Nix repl; raised to a 60000ms floor.
#   4. engine dir — CAMOUFOX_INSTALL_DIR (with the U; that is camoufox-js's
#      spelling) is pinned to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/camoufox (persistent, not $HOME).
#   5. playwright-core pin — camofox-browser asks for `playwright-core ^1.58.0`
#      and camoufox-js declares peer `*`, so npm resolves the LATEST playwright
#      and can outrun the engine's frozen juggler schema. Playwright 1.64 added
#      `bypassServiceWorker` to Network.setRequestInterception and sends it on
#      storage-state pages — the exact call a COOKIE IMPORT makes — so every
#      cookie import 500s while ordinary tab work keeps working. Pinned to the
#      newest compatible release (see CAMOFOX_PLAYWRIGHT_MAX).

# Runtime env for camofox, applied by sourcing this file. Co-locates the GTK/X11

# Shell shim for consumers that cannot source env.sh.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-10-06): the `.replit` "camofox browser"
# workflow ran a bare `camofox-browser`. A workflow task is a NON-interactive
# shell with REPLIT_MODE set, and an old run predated the REPLIT_BASHRC shim,
# so the env snippet never reached it: the server inherited only the pinned
# `[userenv.shared] LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/runner/workspace/.local/lib`, which
# carries the pool but NOT GTK. Camoufox
# then died on every launch with
#   XPCOMGlueLoad error for .../libmozgtk.so: libgtk-3.so.0: cannot open shared
#   object file: No such file or directory
# and, because `camofox.py` imports cookies FIRST, the client only ever showed
#   import failed: {'_http_error': 500, '_body': '{"error":"browserType.launch:
#   Failed to launch the browser process..."}'}
# — i.e. the "refresh page" workflow failed while the browser was dead. 6 logged
# rp runs hit exactly this; it is not an intermittent bug.
#
# Fix: a shim that sources env.sh then execs the npm binary. The NAME IS
# DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT from `camofox-browser`, so it never shadows the npm bin
# on PATH and cannot recurse. Regenerated by `--fix`, so `--doctor` can verify it.
#
# ORDERING: run this AFTER the package + engine are in place (install_camofox
# step 5; --fix derives from the installed payloads). It is best-effort by
# design — it must never fail an install — but it is NOT a substitute for
# installing: each prerequisite is asserted at RUNTIME below, so a half-run
# ("launched the shim, forgot setup.sh --camofox") prints the exact missing
# piece and the one command that fixes it, instead of the loader's
# `libgtk-3.so.0: cannot open shared object file`.

# --- cold store: replit.nix (persistence) + nix-env (immediate) -------------
# Verified fresh-box behaviour (repl-test, 2026-11-05):
# * A fresh workspace has NO replit.nix and a COLD store: `nix eval` resolves
#   gtk3/alsa-lib/libXdamage/xvfb/cacert but none of those paths exist, so
#   generate-closure.sh fails — and a fresh user was told to hand-edit the
#   package list into replit.nix themselves.
# * Writing replit.nix from a command DOES work (it is just a workspace
#   file), but the platform does NOT rebuild on the write (store still cold
#   minutes later, no restart); it applies only at the next platform
#   rebuild/restart. The file alone cannot finish an install in the same run.
# * `nix-env -iA` warms the CURRENT container in seconds (cache.nixos.org ->
#   local overlay store) and feeds generate-closure.sh through its
#   ~/.nix-profile lane. Attr spelling differs per lane: the nix expression
#   in replit.nix wants `pkgs.xorg.xvfb`, while `nix-env -iA` has NO
#   `nixpkgs.xorg.xvfb` attr (verified: "attribute 'xvfb' ... not found") —
#   the legacy attr that ships a working Xvfb is `nixpkgs.xorg.xorgserver`.
# * `nix --store /nix/store build nixpkgs#xorg.xvfb` is NOT a substitute:
#   its output lands in the chroot store (/nix/store/nix/store/<hash>) and
#   is invisible to the shell that checks for it (references/nix.md §3b).
# So: declare in replit.nix for the next rebuild AND nix-env for now. The
